# Seattle-Housing-Price-Analysis
The project analyzes Seattle housing data to identify factors influencing property prices, including location, size, and condition. By predicting house prices using machine learning, the goal is to help real estate agents offer tailored, affordable solutions and estimate future property values.

# Project Overview
In this project, we analyze the housing information for Seattle to better understand the factors that influence property prices. Real estate plays a critical role in neighborhood development, and prices are influenced by various features such as property condition, location, and other qualitative factors. As the demand for personal accommodation rises with population growth, it is crucial to understand what drives these changes in pricing. The goal of this project is to provide deeper insights into the Seattle housing market, identifying key factors that impact customer preferences and housing prices, such as:
House location
Total area
Number of bedrooms
Other property characteristics
